# Mobility Stretching Queue

- Reactjs
- Material UI

I've historically always been incredibly inflexible through my legs, and terrible at remembering to stretch thoroughly. Typically favouring those stretches which I enjoy, not those that I should do to fix the imbalances.

So I've create a clean and easy Reactjs Progressive Web App which I can save to my phone and treat as a regular App Store app.

This app holds a configurable queue of stretches, has a timer and alarm when the timer finishes. It's super lightweight, works offline, and uses local device storage to remember where you left off last time.
